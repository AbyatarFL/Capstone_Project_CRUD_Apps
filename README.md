# Capstone_Project_Module1_CRUD_Apps
## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub. This is my first repository as a student in the Purwadhika Job Connector Data Science Program. This project contains Python basics regarding the create, read, update and delete (CRUD) method implemented in a simple program (simple car rental application)
## Program Introduction
This car rental program is a simulation when a car rental owner wants to manage the list of vehicles in his shop. This program allows owners to view a list of cars, add cars to the list, delete cars from the list and also update their car stock.

Apart from that, this program also has a feature to simulate when a customer wants to rent a car (Additional Features).

The main menu of this program is as follows:

### Feature
1. List of Vehicles

   This menu allows the user to view the entire list of vehicles (sub menu 1) or a partial list of vehicles, by inputting the brand of vehicle they want to display (sub menu 2) and go back to main menu (sub menu 3).

2. Add a vehicle to the list

   This menu allows users to add vehicles to the list by entering new data (category, brand, type, year, stock & price).

3. Delete vehicle data

   This menu allows the user to delete vehicle data that is no longer needed by entering the vehicle code.

6. Exit Program

Note: make sure your device has the python environment installed when you want to try running the program, and as a disclaimer this program is a simple simulation and will not affect the original management of the car rental. This program is for educational purposes only.
